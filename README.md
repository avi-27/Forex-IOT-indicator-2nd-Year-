## A Internet of Things project done with the help of NodeMCU to detect changes in any two currency systems with notification application for android
Team Project 

### The ESP8266 connects to the internet via Wi-Fi and grabs the Forex Rates every 10 seconds. Based on the movement of this value, it sends a UART message to the Arduino Uno (Rise / Fall /Unchanged) The NodeMCU receives this UART message and accordingly lights up an indication LED (Green / Red / Yellow).

###  Technologies we have used :-
     <li> Arduino IDE</li>
     <li> Blynk</li>
     <li> Thingspeak</li>
     <li> ESP8266-NODEMCU</li>
