Team Project 

### The ESP8266 connects to the internet via Wi-Fi and grabs the Forex Rates every 10 seconds. Based on the movement of this value, it sends a UART message to the Arduino Uno (Rise / Fall /Unchanged) The NodeMCU receives this UART message and accordingly lights up an indication LED (Green / Red / Yellow).

Technologies we have used :- <br/>
* Arduino IDE . <br/>
* Blynk .<br/>
* Thingspeak .<br/>
* ESP8266-NODEMCU .<br/>
